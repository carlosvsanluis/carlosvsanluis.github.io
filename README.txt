Photos and sass actions were manipulated lightly for the sole purpose of trying different sliders in teh CSS.

The scrolling backgrounds were all edited to match the original HTML bu man was that hard!



	CSS:

		Look for this line in css/style.css (line 108 as of this writing):

			background: #348cb2 url("images/bg.jpg") bottom left;

		and use it to set the page background color, URL, and placement of
		your image. It should be as close to 1500px wide as you can get it.

	Sass:

		Set the value of $bg to the page background color, URL, and placement
		of your image. Change $bg-width if your image is something other than
		1500px wide.
